# VHDL- Programming

This repository contains the VHDL coding projects from the Digital Microelectronics 2 course which I took at Aalto University. The files do not follow any order but range from as simple as creating a testbench for a 2 to 1 MUX and as complex as implementing functionality of PIC microcontroller.
