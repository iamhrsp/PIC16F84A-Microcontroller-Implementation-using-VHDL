# PIC16F84A Microcontroller project
Design and implementation of PIC16F84A microcontroller as shown by the pipeline architecture.

* Program counter and Stack has been added to the microcontroller designed so far.

* A simple assembly language program has been written whose HEX file is generated using Piklab.

* This HEX file is used as a source of Instructions for the microcontroller.

* The Instructions from the HEX file are read using functions defined in **read_intel_hex_pack** package in the **hexfile_reader.vhd** file.
